3Devo platform and board files for Arduino
==========================================
These files allow using the Devoboard in the Arduino IDE, allowing
access to all pins on the board. To install, make a clone if this
repository into your Sketchbook/hardware folder (so you would have
`Sketchbook/hardware/3devo/avr/platform.txt`, for example).
