# STM32_Programmer.sh uses --go for this, which might be a non-standard
# extension. dfu-util has --detach, which complains about being
# unsupported and --reset which does not seem to work (at least not with
# the jumper still in place, so it probably resets the board, jumping back
# into the bootloader again). Possibly adding :leave can be added to the
# address to send a "leave" command.
